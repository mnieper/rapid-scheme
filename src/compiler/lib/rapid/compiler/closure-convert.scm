    ;;   - Create a map that maps variables to expression or BOTTOM
    ;;     that map is threaded through the ast walking code
    ;;     Aliases for other variables or constants are mapped to the actual value
    ;;     If x is unbound it is mapped to BOTTOM
    ;;   - At the same time determine required free variables
