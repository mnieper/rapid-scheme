See the end of this file for copyrights and conditions.

See the README file for instructions for reporting bugs.

Version 0.1.3 (18 July 2016)

* Use Rapid Scheme's reader in compiled programs.  The backend does
  not have to provide a read procedure anymore.

* Bug fixes.

Version 0.1.2 (10 July 2016)

* Run a modified version of the algorithm "Fixing letrec (reloaded)"
  as described by Dybvig and Ghuloum as the second pass in the
  middle-end. This eliminates multiple-values mutually dependent
  definitions. Only procedures are bound with letrec, all other values
  with let-values.

Version 0.1.1 (07 July 2016)

* Run a simple lambda-lift pass at the first pass in the middle-end.
  This pass guarantees that all procedures are bound to identifiers.

Version 0.1.0 (06 July 2016)

* Initial preview release.
