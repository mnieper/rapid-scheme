See the README file for instructions for reporting bugs.

Version 0.2.1

* CPS-transform the result of the fixing-letrec pass.  This eliminates
  let-values, multiple assignments, call/cc and the continuation mark
  primitives.

* Eliminate mutable variables after the CPS-transform.  This
  eliminates set! and introduces cell primitives.

* Bind all procedures to variables and access them only through the
  bound identifier.  This happens after the pass that eliminates
  mutable variables.

* Remove the lambda-lift pass, which never did a complete lambda
  lifting, and which will be unneccessary anyway once closure
  conversion is implemented.

Version 0.2.0 (07 August 2016)

* Switch to the GNU Build system.

Version 0.1.3 (18 July 2016)

* Use Rapid Scheme's reader in compiled programs.  The backend does
  not have to provide a read procedure anymore.

* Bug fixes.

Version 0.1.2 (10 July 2016)

* Run a modified version of the algorithm "Fixing letrec (reloaded)"
  as described by Dybvig and Ghuloum as the second pass in the
  middle-end. This eliminates multiple-values mutually dependent
  definitions. Only procedures are bound with letrec, all other values
  with let-values.

Version 0.1.1 (07 July 2016)

* Run a simple lambda-lift pass at the first pass in the middle-end.
  This pass guarantees that all procedures are bound to identifiers.

Version 0.1.0 (06 July 2016)

* Initial preview release.
