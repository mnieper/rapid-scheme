/* Garbage collection internals
 *
 * Pointers are aligned at 8 byte boundaries.
 * The lowest bit has to be cleared to 0 so that it is not mistaken as an integer.
 * Thus it leaves 2 bits to mark pointers: xy0
 *
 * Bit 000: ordinary pointer
 * Bit 010: pointer to head of module
 * Bit 100: head of vector
 * Bit 110: forwarded vector
 *
 * When object points to another object, scan until head of vector is found.
 * If this is forwarded, adjust pointer.  Otherwise, move whole vector (must move whole module).
 * => no special vector head... => vector just points to head
