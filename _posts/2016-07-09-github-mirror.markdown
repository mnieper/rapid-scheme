Yesterday, I have set up a GitHub mirror of the main repository of
Rapid Scheme, which is hosted at GitLab.  This is for convenience for
those hackers that are on GitHub.  All development, however, is
happening at GitLab.

If you are interested in why I have chosen GitLab for hosting Rapid
Scheme, I can recommend to read [GitLab, Gitorious, and Free
Software](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/05/20/gitlab-gitorious-free-software/).
