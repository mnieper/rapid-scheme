Yesterday, I have set up a [GitHub
mirror](https://github.com/mnieper/rapid-scheme) of the [main
repository of Rapid Scheme](https://gitlab.com/nieper/rapid-scheme),
which is hosted at GitLab.  This is for convenience for those hackers
that are on GitHub.  All development, however, is happening at GitLab.

If you are interested in why I have chosen GitLab for hosting Rapid
Scheme, I can recommend to read [GitLab, Gitorious, and Free
Software](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/05/20/gitlab-gitorious-free-software/).
