Only a few days after its first preview release, Rapid Scheme has
already found its first application!
[okuoku](https://github.com/okuoku) has set up a [project on
GitHub](https://github.com/okuoku/rapid-gambit) that uses Rapid Scheme
as a frontend for the R5RS system [Gambit](gambitscheme.org). So
compiling R7RS programs with Gambit is now in reach!

The author of Rapid Scheme was quite surprised when he learnt that it
doesn't need to much code to make Rapid's output digestible for an
R5RS system.
