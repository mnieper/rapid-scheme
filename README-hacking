Autotools
---------

This distribution uses quite recent versions of the Autotools.  Older
versions may work; please report success to the author.


Host Scheme system
------------------

As Rapid Scheme is written in Scheme code as described by R7RS, a
suitable implementation of the R7RS is needed. The configure scripts
distributed with the development sources assumes that a sufficiently
recent build of Chibi Scheme is installed on the system, however any
other Scheme system that fully implements the R7RS should also work.


Building
--------

After installing Chibi Scheme (or any other implementation of the R7RS
after suitably patching the provided configuration files), you can run

  ./bootstrap

to do a fresh build.  After the first time, running make should
suffice to build the system.


Run tests
---------

You can run

  make check

to execute the provided tests.
