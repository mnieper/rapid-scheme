Tools
-----

As Rapid Scheme is written in Scheme code as described by R7RS, a
suitable implementation of the R7RS is needed. The Makefile distributed
with the development sources assumes that a sufficiently new development
version of Larceny (the release 0.99 still contains a few unfortunate bugs
that are fixed in the development sources) is installed on the system, however
any other Scheme system that fully implements the R7RS should also work.
(Chibi Scheme has been proven to work, but it is several orders of magnitude
slower than Larceny.)


Building
--------

After installing Larceny (or any other implementation of the R7RS after suitably
patching the provided Makefile), you can run

  make

to build the two executables ./rapid-scheme and ./rapid-compile.


Run tests
---------

You can run

  make check

to execute the provided tests.


Compiling Scheme programs
-------------------------

You can run the program ./rapid-compile to expand Scheme programs as described by the
R7RS. You need to add the -I share option so that the standard library of the R7RS
can be found. The expanded program is written to stdout, and is self-contained apart from
a minimal runtime exported by (rapid primitive).


Execute Scheme programs
-----------------------

You can run the program ./rapid-scheme to expand and evaluate Scheme programs as described
by the R7RS. You need to add the -I share option so that the standard library of the R7RS
can be found.


Compiler Front-end
-----------------

The compiler frontend reads text files containing Scheme programs and
library definitions, imports libraries and macro-expands the code.
The output of the frontend is a very restricted subset of R7RS code.
The main binding construct is letrec*-values.

Compiler Middle-end
-------------------

The middle-end consists of a number of passes executed in succession:

  * lambda-lift: Procedures are hoisted as far as possible without
    changing their signatures.  All procedures become bound to
    identifiers.  The main binding construct is still letrec*-values.

  * fix-letrec: The letrec*-values binding construct is rewritten
    according to the algorithm described by Abdulaziz Ghuloum and Kent
    Dybvig in "Fixing Letrec (reloaded)" extended to handle multiple
    value bindings.  The binding construct for procedure variables becomes
    letrec.  All other variables are bound by let-values.  Multiple
    assignments by set!-values are introduced in this pass.

Compiler Back-end
-----------------

The back-end simply writes the output of the middle-end as valid R7RS
code.
